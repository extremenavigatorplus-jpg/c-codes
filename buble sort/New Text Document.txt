# Simple Bubble Sort in C

A minimal and easy-to-understand implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm written in C. This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how basic sorting works.

## 🚀 How It Works
Bubble Sort is a comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.



- **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ (In-place)

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run this code, you need a C compiler installed on your system, such as:
* **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection)
* **Clang**
* **MSVC** (Visual Studio)
