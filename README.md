An interactive, command-line interface (CLI) application developed in C that demonstrates the **Stack** data structure using **Dynamic Linked Lists**. This project was created as part of my university coursework in Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 🛠 Features
This implementation goes beyond basic `push` and `pop`. It includes:
* **Dynamic Memory**: Uses `malloc` and `free` for efficient memory management.
* **In-Place Reversal**: A custom algorithm to reverse the stack without extra space.
* **Safety Checks**: Built-in protection against **Stack Underflow**.
* **Global Tracking**: Keeps a real-time count of all elements in the stack.

## 📂 Project Structure
| Feature | Function Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Push** | `push(int x)` | Adds a new node to the top. |
| **Pop** | `pop()` | Removes the top node and returns its value. |
| **Reverse** | `reverse()` | Reverses the entire stack using pointer manipulation. |
| **Peek** | `peek()` | Views the top element without removing it. |
